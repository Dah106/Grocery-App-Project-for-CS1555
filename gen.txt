Note for Danchen

The data must be dynamic and not pulled from a data file. For example, when
you execute the jdbc application, it should ask the user how many customers it would like,
how many warehouses, how many items, etc... It doesnt have to include a question for every table
because some tables depend on other tables. For example, you just need to ask as many questions that will allow
the database to be filled so you dont need all of the details.

Also, I got other details. we dont need triggers. We just have to make sure that the JDBC application inserts
data that is consistent across all tables.
